\f0\fs24 \cf0 The name of my project is \'93Escaping the Dungeons of 112\'94. The main objective of this game is to collect 5 coins that are hidden around the map and successfully make it out of the maze without getting caught by the monster. The player\'92s field of vision is limited, thus he must carefully make his way through the dungeon and when he is in the proximity of the monster, the monster will start to chase the player down until the player is no longer within a certain range of the monster.\
\
The user should run the file named \'93Escaping the Dungeons of 112.py\'94 in the editor. All the other files should not be moved or touched when the zip file is decompressed.\
\
One shortcut command (not really a shortcut though) is that if the player is moving too slowly, you can hold down shift and use the WASD keys to sprint rather than walk.}
